Aim of iamintrouble was to create an android app, 
which can engage social contacts using one's social media network like facebook friends for help in emergency

It also is used as a chained network to engage people in similar situations
who are unable to contact others.

Other features include Live surveillance  i.e Using the camera of the phone like a surveillance camera, and the app can record and live stream everything on its own. Especially useful if one is in a life-threatening situation like kidnapping, mugging.
We also added support for emergency Trigger by shaking the phone.
